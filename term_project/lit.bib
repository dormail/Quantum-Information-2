abstract = {We show that the notion of generalized Berry phase i.e., non-abelian holonomy, can be used for enabling quantum computation. The computational space is realized by a n-fold degenerate eigenspace of a family of Hamiltonians parametrized by a manifold M. The point of M represents classical configuration of control fields and, for multi-partite systems, couplings between subsystem. Adiabatic loops in the control M induce non trivial unitary transformations on the computational space. For a generic system it is shown that this mechanism allows for universal quantum computation by composing a generic pair of loops in M.}

abstract = {Abstract Geometric phases induced in quantum evolutions have built-in noise-resilient characters, and thus can find applications in many robust quantum manipulation tasks. Here, a feasible and fast scheme for universal quantum computation on superconducting circuits with nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric phases is proposed, using resonant interaction of three-level quantum system. In this scheme, arbitrary single-qubit quantum gates can be implemented in a single-loop scenario by shaping both the amplitudes and phases of the two driving microwave fields resonantly coupled to a transmon device. Moreover, nontrivial two-qubit gates can also be realized with an auxiliary transmon simultaneously coupled to the two target transmons in an effective resonant way. In particular, this proposal can be compatible to various optimal control techniques, which further enhances the robustness of the quantum operations. Therefore, this proposal represents a promising way toward fault-tolerant quantum computation on solid-state quantumÂ circuits.},
